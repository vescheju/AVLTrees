Lots of my code came with help of zybooks and is pseudo code, found here:
https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/MSUCSE331OnsaySpring2020/chapter/25/section/3

For this project I used the rotations, set_child, replace_child, rebalance, insert, and remove
from zybooks.

I also looked at the pseudo code from: https://d2l.msu.edu/d2l/le/content/911577/viewContent/8314599/View?ou=911577

These had algorithms to look at different traversals, which I implemented.


I also had no clue at first how to use yield and yield from so I looked at the following links,
these links only show how to use yield and yield from.

For the last function I went to the help room, and was able to figure it out after a simple example by a TA.
